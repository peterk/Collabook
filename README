Collabook Wordpress theme
-------------------------

Collabook is a Wordpress theme for collaborative editing/review of a document.
The document itself is created by editing standard Wordpress pages in a
hierarchy. Users comment on the individual pages to give feedback. The idea is
to enable a group of editors and a large community to participate in a
transparent creation of a document.
