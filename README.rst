Collabook Wordpress theme
=========================

Collabook is a clean Wordpress theme for collaborative editing/review of a
document. The document is created by editing standard Wordpress pages in a
hierarchy. Users comment on the individual pages to give feedback. The idea is
to enable a group of editors and a large community to participate in a
transparent creation of a document.

Collabook is implemented as a Thematic child theme. Although some templates are
overriden, the only addition to the markup is WAI ARIA landmark roles and an
adjustment of heading levels in the comment section.

The theme adjusts the doctype to HTML5 to make sure validation fanatics don√§t
freak out over the WAI ARIA landmark roles. See functions.php for more information.
